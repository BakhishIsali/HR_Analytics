Key Findings:
Employees with high satisfaction levels were less likely to leave, as evidenced by the heatmap correlation.
The distribution of attrition across departments revealed fascinating patterns. Some departments had significantly higher attrition rates.
Work accidents seemed to play a role in employee retention. Those with no accidents were less likely to leave.
Salary also played a vital role. Higher salary tiers showed a lower attrition rate.

Machine Learning:
For predictive analysis, I leveraged Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting algorithms to predict employee attrition.
